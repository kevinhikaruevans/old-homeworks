	Was I supposed to sweep $V_{gs}$ through negative voltages or flip the polarity of the dc supply? The instructions didn't mention it and I thought that was a little strange...

	\subsubsection*{(d) Discussion}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[i.] The NMOS operates in the cutoff--triode--saturation region as $V_{ds}$ increases. Current runs from the top terminal (drain) to the lower (bottom). The PMOS operates in the cutoff--saturation region as $V_{ds}$ increases and is operating ``flipped'', as the current is running from the lower terminal up to the top. As the PMOS is acting in reverse, the current plots are flipped.
		
		\item[ii.] The NMOS curve family experiences all three regions: \begin{itemize}
			\item The lower $V_{gs}$ curves are in the cutoff region, where $V_{GS} < \SI{0.4}{\V}$. The threshold voltage $V_{tn}$ is around \num{0.267} to \SI{0.4}{\V}.
			\item For the upper curves ($V_{gs} \ge 0.4$), the left-side is in the triode region, the right-side is in the saturation region.
			\item For example: the orange curve ($V_{gs} = 1.2$), it is in the triode region from $V_{DS} \approx 0$ to $0.7$. After $0.7$, it is in the saturation region.
		\end{itemize}
	
		For the PMOS: 
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All the plots are in the cutoff region until current begins to flow. For $V_{gs} > 0.5$ or so, the transistors barely exit from the cutoff region.
			\item It only operates at saturation afterwards, as the drain-source terminals are flipped in this situation. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item[iii.] The plots are the showing the expected current behavior. For the NMOS, the curves go through the cutoff--triode--saturation regions. The PMOS goes from the cutoff to the saturation as the transistor as the threshold voltage is negative and the drain-source voltage is negative as well.
		
		\item[iv.] If you double the transistor width, the $k_n$ and $k_p$ values are doubled, so the current through the drain/source will double as $i_D \propto k \propto W$. As an example, if you have an NMOS in both the triode/saturation region (red dashed line) and double the width, you would expect the current to double (blue solid line):
