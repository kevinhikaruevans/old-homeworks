		\item The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that describes Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The equation features a nonlinear addition to the Schrodinger equation approximating the particle interaction as a mean-field Hartree-Fock term. It is interesting that quantum mechanics described by the Schr\"odinger equation is linear and linearity does not bring chaos---however, classical mechanics routinely shows chaos. Here, chaos is calculated by Lyapunov exponents, the exponential divergence in distances in Hilbert space.
		
		
		Here, we characterize chaos within the GPE in one-dimension with Lyapunov exponents. This will be accomplished by simulating the GPE using a finite-differences technique with an adaptive solver. The many-particle wavefunctions will be initialized with turbulence by imparting random phase noise and allowing the function to evolve before perturbing. 
		 We will show that chaos is introduced linearly as a function of the interaction term $g$ for positive coupling-term coefficients.
