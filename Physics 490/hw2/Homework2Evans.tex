	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I've found the \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/wsu-dissertation-thesis-latex-template/fgzqxkvxnsqy}{template on Overleaf} and have attached a copy with title page and abstract.
		
			
		\item I briefly went through \href{https://tug.org/pracjourn/2008-1/mori/mori.pdf}{the guide by Lapo Mori on tug.org}, which seems like a good source.
		
		Both have similar guidelines: organizing chapters in separate files, have similar sections, and go through the initial setup. The main differences are the styling and they both use slightly different pages (and documentclasses). The tug.org also suggests using the simple \texttt{center} environment for tables, whereas Overleaf suggests using the \texttt{table} environment.
				
		\item I've attached the outline.
