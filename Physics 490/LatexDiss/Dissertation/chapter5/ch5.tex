\chapter{Conclusions}
We confirm our hypothesis that the nonlinearity of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation gives rise to chaos.
We have seen for positive $g$ returns positive Lyapunov exponents, implying chaotic motion in Bose-Einstein condensates. For the $g=0$ case, our assumption is correct in that it returns a zero Lyapunov exponent, which is consistent with the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation. For positive coupling constant $g$, there is a proportionality found between the constant and the Lyapunov exponent. The nonlinear coupling constant term is seemingly the cause of this chaos, understandably as chaos cannot arise from linearity. The chaotic dependence on $g$ reproduces the results by Brezinova, et al. \cite{PhysRevA.83.043611} using finite difference numerical methods. It is still unclear whether this chaos is caused by the failure of the GPE or of it exists in reality.

When finding the Lyapunov exponent, it was noted that the first iteration before pulling back was likely in the wrong direction of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. This Lyapunov exponent should be dropped or additional, perhaps hundreds, iterations should be run. Additional research is necessary to extend these findings to higher dimensions and to systems with quantum turbulence.
