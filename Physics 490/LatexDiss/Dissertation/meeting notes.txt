- superfluids and helium, should mention
- it's not the interaction, just the # of particles

dft kohn & holnberg - replace wavefunction by 

- replacing a wavefunction of n varaibles w/ a single wavefunction
- gpe is a density functional
- gpe is an approximation
- classical limit of many body wavefunciton
	mean field approximation


---

chaos is classical, etc.
where does it come from in qm, linear
come earlier

---

an analog to the lyapunov exponent, not a true lyapunov exponent
it's not a true one, several subtlties

---

expectation values

---
since the gpe provides a good charactierizaton of cold atom fluiods
if we see chaos in gpe -> suggests we could see quantum chaos 

---

wavefunction has to have n particles
add i's to psi
product on psi


---

if we can show the initial time w/o increase
pull back
say you can't take the t to inf limit

you get 2.8 if you minimize the phase

---
add pull backs
in plot

state hypothesis
