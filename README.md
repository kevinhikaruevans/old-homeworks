# old-homeworks

This repository contains some old homework solutions that I wrote during my junor & senior year of undergrad at WSU. I might import additional homeworks as I find them scattered on my harddrives.

The stuff in here is mostly:

- TeX
- C code
- Verilog/VHDL

Some of these solutions are wrong or incomplete, so don't just copy these, but perhaps they might give you some guidance if you're stuck! 

## Notable ones

I probably put the most effort into typesetting these ones:

- [EE 362](EE362) - Electronics lab
- [Math 364](<Math 364>) - Linear programming
- [Math 301](<Math 301>) - Intro to mathematical reasoning
- [Physics 341](<Physics 341>) / [Physics 342](<Physics 342>) - E&M
- [Physics 450](<Physics 450>) - Quantum mechanics
- [Physics 465](<Physics 465>) - Nuclear physics
- [Physics 463](<Physics 463>) - Solid state physics
